APR' S
For the specific date of August 10th, data was not being pulled. The root cause was an error in the query of convoxccs_agent_log, where a BIGINT UNSIGNED value was out of range in the expression (\convoxccs32`.`L`.`talk_sec` - `convoxccs32`.`L`.`hold_sec`)`.
*The issue was fixed by adding a condition after the WHERE clause in the query: {,SUM(IF(L.talk_sec>L.hold_sec,SEC_TO_TIME(L.talk_sec)-SEC_TO_TIME(L.hold_sec),L.talk_sec)) AS talk_sec,}
